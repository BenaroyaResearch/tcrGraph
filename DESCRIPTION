Title: Utilities for graph-based analysis of T cell receptors
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Mario Rosasco
Maintainer: Mario Rosasco <mrosasco@benaroyaresearch.org>
Description: A collection of tools to analyze T cell receptor features, based on building a similarity graph. In the graph representation, nodes represent individual TCR chains, and edges represent a shared feature of biological interest, such as nucleotide sequence or CDR3 amino acid sequence. Looking at TCRs in this way can be useful for inferring T cell clonality, and looking at patterns associated with antigen specificity.
